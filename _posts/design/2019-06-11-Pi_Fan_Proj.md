<h3><em>Why build a fan control regulator?</em> </h3>
<p>I built project because I was simply interested in seeing if I understood simple electronic circuits and digital control well enough to get it working. Turns out ...&#128516;... I do... So, I decide to share what I have made with anyone who cares.  It has always been a persoal goal to achieve software to hardware functionally. Basically, I wanted to use the knowledge I have writing computer code to really make the rubber meet the road. I wanted to build a circuit and control it with a computer,<strong> without catastrophe</strong>. So, I thought, well my garage Raspberry Pi3 gets pretty hot in the summer and I have a random scavanged 12V fan, can I make it control its own temperature. Answer, yes... very easily in fact.</p>
