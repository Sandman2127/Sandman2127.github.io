<h2><strong>Building a computer from integrated circuits and wires </strong></h2>
<p>As with any project one of the most important questions, why do it in the first place? When I first looked at <a href="https://eater.net/8bit/"> Ben Eaters plans to make a computer on a breadboard</a>I was instantly hooked. I decided then and there, if it could be done, I would do it. In the <a href="/design/Tesla_Coil">tesla coil project</a> I discovered the hard way that reading about the principles of electronics vs building electronics in real life require entirely different levels of understanding. For quite some time I have been enthralled by the idea of unvieling the mysteries of the electrical world I knew this might be the project that put me over the top, the one that made me a definable electrical wizard. I was right, when you build a computer from scratch you move to the next level and then you jump 8 more. The rules of physics are the only bounds that exist.</p>
