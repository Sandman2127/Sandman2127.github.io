<h2><em>So you built a tesla coil...</em><strong>Why would anyone do that for fun???</strong></h2>
<p>The idea of the Tesla coil come from its inventor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a>. A visionary genius, Nikola Tesla revolutionized humanities ability to harness electrical power, and in the end his Alternating Current (AC) won out in the <strong>War Of Currents</strong> against Thomas Edison.Along the way he designed several incredible electrical devices including: the AC transformer (transforms AC voltages to higher or lower levels), the AC induction motor, a steam powered electricity generator (He lit up the Chicago worlds fair in 1893 for the first time ever) and the incredible but highly inefficient Tesla Coil. The idea of the Tesla Coil was to transmit power directly the people. Thats right, through the air without the need for wires. We now know that he was obviously unsuccessful, but his idea is an incredible source of inspiration, and furthermore he didn't completely fail. Actually the Tesla coil does work, but it its highly inefficient because of the inverse square law that all EM waves including the ones his coil produced simply must follow. Transmitting power for our daily uses is simply to inefficient, not to mention dangerous (imagine people with pacemakers...)</p>
