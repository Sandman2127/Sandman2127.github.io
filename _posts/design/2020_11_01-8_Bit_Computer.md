<h2><strong>Building a computer from integrated circuits and wires</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> As with any project one of the most important questions, why do it?When I first looked at <a href="https://eater.net/8bit/"> Ben Eaters plans to make a computer on a breadboard</a> I was instantly hooked. I decided then and there, if it could be done, I would do it. In the tesla coil project I had learned, reading about an electrical device vs actually making it in real life require entirely different levels of understanding. I knew this might be the project that put me over the top, the one that made me a definable electrical wizard. I was right, when you build a computer from scratch you move to the next level and then you jump 8 more. The rules of physics are the only bounds that exist.</p>
