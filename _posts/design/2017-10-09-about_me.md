The beginning of my scientific quest:

I guess the reason I'm even here able to design a website and share my story is because I desire to understand how things work. Curiosity for the universe's endless wonders is one of my most core personality traits. The story starts when I was a sophmore in high school. As soon as I got my first car, I began to my fathers bewilderment, pulling it apart and rebuilding it. You can only imagine the look on his face... Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!! Why son, why? I give you a car and you've converted it to a barely functional pile of parts. What neither of us realized at the time was that I was inadvertently teaching myself the fundamentals of combustion engines, hydraulics and basic principles of harnessing electricity. Although I am still fascinated by the topics I learned in those early years, the most useful thing I got out of my exploration of car mechanics was not the knowledge gained on engine cooling or braking systems but how to teach myself a new subject matter. And indeed I have, since those early days I have become knowledgable in the academic pursuits of microbiology, plant genetics, and bioinformatics. I've leveraged my mechanical knowledge to build a bacterial biofilm reactors (link) and a functional fluorescence macroscope (link). I've found that among the things driving me in life: curiosity and a fascination with understanding are the two primary traits that have dominated who I have become and where I ended up. Over my time in graduate school i've focused on understanding biological questions and a few of my own about who and what I am.   


Currently I'm starting my 5th year of graduate school and the life of research has been both rewarding and
exhausting. In my work I spend approximately 60% of my time performing computational data analysis and the other 40% developing and performing experiments. Our studies focus and stress and epigenetics
